                                <p> A database consists of a collection of files where each file contains a sequence of records corresponding to a relation. These records spread across several blocks when stored in the disk, depending on the number of records that can fit into a block. A block also contains a pointer to the next block of the file, allowing sequential search on the records of a file. A relation is defined by a set of attributes. Each record is a set of values corresponding to those attributes. </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                On developing a database of your own, it is essential that we have access to records stored in the disk without much time delay. Disk access is a high-latency operation. Therefore, as the size of relation increases, searching records that satisfy certain conditions by accessing every record in the disk blocks, can adversely affect the performance. This necessitates indexing.
                                </p>
                                
                               
                        
                            </div>     
                        
                            
                            <div class="detail" id="indexing">
                                <h2>Understanding Indexing</h2>
                                
                                <p>Creating an index on an attribute of a relation is basically creating a data structure that holds the attribute value and a pointer to the records. It enables us to speed up the retrieval of records in response to certain search conditionns on the attribute value. An <b>index</b> in a database is very much like the index in a book. And, just as a book's index points to locations within the book, a database's index points to records within the disk. The database organizes the indices such that these pointer values can be found extremely fast. And, once the database has located the desired set of pointer values, it can then turn around and quickly read the full record. In the end, a database index is a means to locate and read table data as quickly as possible. </p>
                                <p>
                                Consider a query to fetch records with a particular attribute value greater than X. Suppose, you create an index for that attribute. When a new index is created for a (relation, attribute) pair, the database system creates a new data structure which is again stored in different blocks in the disk, say Index Blocks. For a given value of the attribute, this disk data structure helps us to locate  the data block(s) that contain the records of the relation  with the attribute value that satisfies our search condition(attribute value >X). Consequently, we require much lesser number of disk accesses than a linear search on the blocks of the file. </p>
                                <p>
                                Thus, the objective of creating an index on an (attribute, relation) pair, is to make search operation on a relation for records with attribute value that satisfy a search condition, faster than linear search on the blocks of the file. If n is the number of records in a file, the time required to search based on an attribute is only O(log n) whereas it would take  O(n) time for a linear search in the absence of an index. 
                                Creating an index itself is an expensive operation requiring O(n) time and space. Hence indices are normally created only on those attributes on which frequent queries are performed on the database. </p>
                                <p>As index is a collection of attribute values and their corresponding record pointers, the <b>structure of the index</b> plays a key role in determining how fast the index can be accessed and the kind of queries that can be proccessed.
    
                                Perhaps one of the most common types of index structures is the <b><a href="Bplustreedetails.html"  target="_blank">B+ Tree</a></b>. It is a self-balancing, sorted variation on the binary tree structure that stores the index values in a relatively shallow but wide shape. NITCbase uses B+ Tree for indexing records. </p>

                            <p>

                            In NITCbase, each <a href="../storage-model.html#record_blk"  target="_blank">Record block</a> is of size 2048 bytes of which first 32 bytes is allocated for the header that gives the metadata of the block. Consider a record block structure for a relation with K attributes. The size allotted for an attribute is 16 bytes. <br>
                            Number of slots (Maximum number of records, L) that fits in a Record block for any given relation can be calculated as:</p>

                                <b><p> \[ 
                                
                                \#Slots = L = \left \lfloor \frac {2048 - 32} {((16 * \#Attributes(K)) + 1)} \right \rfloor \] </p></b>
                                <p>
                                Suppose there are R records in the relation , we would require B block accesses(equivalent to the number of Record Blocks required to store the relation) in order to traverse through the entire relation.</p>
                                <b><p> \[ 
                                
                                B = \#Record Blocks = \left \lceil \frac {R} {L} \right \rceil
                                       
                                \]</p></b>


                                <p>
                                As the size of the relation increases, this value B could be very large. Inorder to optimize the performance of the database by minimizing the number of disk accesses required when a Search query is processed, indexing is used. <br>
                                As mentioned earlier, NITCBase uses B+ tree data structure for indexing records in a relation. There are two types of nodes for a B+ tree. These are called internal nodes and leaf nodes. A disk block that stores an internal node of the B+ tree is called an <a href="../storage-model.html#intind_blk"  target="_blank">Internal Index block</a>. Each internal index block in NITCBase stores a maximum of 100 attribute values. Each of these values has an associated pair of left and right child pointers.Since the right child of one value is the same as the left child of the next value each Internal Index block stores 101 child pointers.<br>
                                A leaf node in the B+ tree stores the actual Record pointers for the records in a relation. A disk block that stores a leaf node of a B+ tree is called a <a href="../storage-model.html#leafind_blk"  target="_blank">Leaf Index Block</a> which is also of 2048 bytes with first 32 bytes storing the header.Each index stored in the leaf block is a 3-tuple (attribute value-16 bytes, block number-4 bytes, slot number-4 bytes and 8 bytes of unused space). So the maximum number of leaf indices that can be stored in a Leaf Index Block is:

                               <b><p> \[ 
                                
                                 Maximum Leaf Entries = \left \lfloor \frac {2016} {32} \right \rfloor = 63 \] </p></b>
                                <p>

                                As a consequence, more number of records can be accessed through record pointers stored in an Index block with respect to an attribute resulting in a much lesser disk block accesses to process a query.

                               </p>

                               <br>
                               <p>Let us understand indexing in NITCbase with an example.</p>

                                            Number of slots (Maximum number of records, L) that fits in a block for the given relation can be calculated as:

                                                   = \left \lfloor \frac {2016} {((16 * 10 + 1)} \right \rfloor = 12

                                            <p>Therefore, the number of record blocks required to store the given relation is: </p>

                                             To proccess our search query in the absence of an Index, we need to fetch all the records from disk blocks one by one, and check if they satisfy our search condition(Attribute_2 >X). This implies that the number of disk accesses required to process a query in the absence of an index is <b>1000</b>.<br>

                                            Suppose, an Index is created on Attribute_2 of this Relation. In NITCBase, the maximum number of entries in an Internal index block and Leaf index block are 100 and 63 respectively. When an Index Block is full, it is split into two, i.e a new Index Block is allocated such that each of them is atleast half full. So, if there is more than one Internal Index Block and Leaf Index Block, the minimum number of entries in an Internal index block and Leaf index block are 50 and 32 respectively. We know that all the attribute values along with their Record Pointers appear in any of the leaf blocks. So the maximum number of Leaf index blocks is:</p>

                                            Given that the minimum number of Internal Index block entries being 50, the minimum number of children is 51.
                                            Therefore, the maximum height of the B+ Tree is :</p>

                                            <p>While traversing down the tree from the root, we access 2 Index Blocks in the disk(including the Leaf Index Block). The final Leaf Index Block gives us the Record Id i.e(Block Number, Slot Number) of the record required. We fetch the record from that Record Block using Record Id.<br>So, the total number of disk accesses required when an Index is created is,  2+1= <b>3</b>.<br>We notice that from 1000 disk accesses to 3 disk accesses, the performance increase is substantial.</p>

                            Now, let us understand the creation of B+ Tree in NITCbase in detail, and Insert and Search operations on it.<br><br>

                            <p>Consider a Relation<b> Student (Name, Roll No, Batch, Marks) </b>with <b>4</b> attributes.<br>An index is to be created on the attribute Roll No.</p><br>
                            <center><img class="img-fluid" src="../img/indexing/Table.png"></center><br>
                            <p>For simplicity and easier understanding, we have taken the size of <a href="../storage-model.html#record_blk"  target="_blank">Record block</a> as <b>320</b> bytes analogous to <b>2048</b> bytes in NITCBase. Therefore, keeping all other factors the same, the number of slots per block would be 4.</p>

                            <b><p> \[

                                                   = \left \lfloor \frac {288} {((16 * 4 + 1)} \right \rfloor = 4
                                            \]</p></b>


                            <p>Given Relation has <b>14 records</b>. Hence, the number of Record blocks required is 4.
                                <b><p> \[

                                            \]</p></b>


                            <br> The Record Block structure is as follows :</p>

                            <center><img class="img-fluid" src="../img/indexing/recordblk.png"></center>
                            <br>
                            <p>As explained earlier, The maximum number of entries in <a href="../storage-model.html#intind_blk"  target="_blank">Internal Index block</a> and <a href="../storage-model.html#leafind_blk"  target="_blank">Leaf Index Block</a> in NITCbase are are  100 and 63 respectively. Here, the maximum entries are taken to be <b>4</b> and <b>3</b> respectively instead of <b>100 </b>and <b>63</b> in NITCBase.<br>
                           We need to create an Index for the <b>attribute RollNo</b>. As discussed in <a href="../storage-model.html">Physical Layer</a>, each <a href="../storage-model.html#attrcat">Attribute Catalog entry</a> contains the <b>Root block Index</b> which stores the root block number of the B+ Tree if there is an index created on the attribute; and contains -1 otherwise.</p>
                           <center><img class="img-fluid" src="../img/indexing/attrcat1.png"></center>
                           <br><p>In order to create the Index, we begin by getting a free Leaf index block, say <b>L1</b> allocated for the root block. (Why?) <br> 
                            We then update the Root Block in the Attribute Catalog Entry.

                            <center><img class="img-fluid" src="../img/indexing/attrcat2.png"></center>
                            <p>We need to insert the following set of key values of the attribute RollNo with respect to each row of the table, in a sequential manner.<br>
                            <b>1,3,8,7,6,4,11,13,10,9,5,12,14,2 </b> <br>
                            We'll see the Insert operation B+ Tree  in detail in the next section.

When 1 is to be inserted, a temporary array of indices containing the entry is created. The purpose of the array is to ensure all the entries are in sorted order. Since the size of the array is less than three, we rewrite the entries of the leaf index block in the sorted order from the array. The header of the block will be updated. <br>

Similarly, 3 and 8 are inserted. The parent block (PBlock) value remains -1 throughout these insertions as there is no parent block introduced in the B+ tree yet.

<p>When the entry 7 is to be inserted, the entries are sorted in the array. However, it cannot be inserted or written into the same block L1 as now the existing leaf block has 3 entries i.e the leaf block is full. A new leaf block, L2 is hence obtained. </p>

<p>Iterate through all the sorted four entries. L1 is overwritten by the first two entries (the first half of the entries) of current block L1 and the next two entries are written into the new leaf block, L2. The headers of both the blocks are updated to incorporate the changes. The RBlock value of L1 is set as L2 and the LBlock value of L2 is set as L1. This is to maintain a linked list of leaf blocks. </p>

<p>A parent block is now required since there has been a split. A new internal index block, I1 is obtained for the same. The last value of the first block obtained on splitting the node, in this example the value 3 is made the entry of the internal index block. This also does not violate the requirement that the maximum number of entries in an internal index block is four. </p>

<p>The left child and right child of this new internal index block are set as L1 and L2 respectively. The parent block value of the child blocks is updated as I1. </p>

The attribute catalog will be updated with the changes including the new root block number.

When 6 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block, I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 6 is greater than 3, we traverse down to the right child of I1. As seen previously, the entries are sorted and since the maximum number of entries in a leaf block is not violated, the entries including the new entry 6 are written back into the block L2 and the number of entries in the header of L2 is updated.

<p>When 4 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 4 is greater than 3, we traverse down to the right child of I1. The entries are sorted. However, in this case, the number of entries in the leaf block will become greater than three if the entry 4 is to be included in L2. Hence a new leaf block, L3 is introduced. L2 is overwritten with the first half of the sorted entries in the array (4,6) and the rest (7,8) are written into L3. The LBlock and RBlock values of the blocks are updated to maintain the linked list. </p>

<p>Since L2 already has a parent block I1 and the number of entries in the parent block is less than four, the last value in the current L2 is the new entry to the parent block. The parent block entries are then sorted and written back into I1. The number of entries in I1 is incremented. The left child and right child of the new entry 6 in the parent block are set as L2 and L3 respectively. </p>

<p>The parent block of L3 is set as I1.</p>

When 14 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 14 is greater than 10, we traverse down to the right child of 10 in I1 which is L5. The entries are sorted. However, in this case, the number of entries in the leaf block L5 will become greater than three if the entry 14 is to be included. Hence a new leaf block, L6 is introduced. L5 is overwritten by the first half of the sorted entries in the array (11,12) and the rest (13,14) are written into L6. The LBlock and RBlock values of the blocks are updated to maintain the linked list. </p>

<p>L5 already has a parent block I1. The last value in L5 and the current entries in I1 are sorted. However, block I1 has reached the maximum number of entries possible in an internal index block i.e the parent block is full. Hence we obtain a new internal index block, I2. We copy the first two entries (3,6) from the sorted entries into the old internal block I1 and the last two entries (10,12) are copied into the new internal block I2. The #Entries attribute of these two blocks is updated and the PBlock attribute of both are kept the same i.e -1.</p>

<p>Since the previous parent block has now been split, a new internal index block, I3 is introduced. The middle value (8) of the previous root which had been stored in a temporary variable is now inserted into I3. The left child and right child of 8 in I3 are set as I1 and I2 respectively. The number of entries in the new internal index block is incremented to 1. The parent block of I1 and I2 is set to I3.</p>

<p>The root block number of this B+ Tree in the attribute catalog is updated to the new root block number.</p>

                    <p>
                    Search is done on attributes that are indexed to get a record hit based on certain search conditions given (i.e op, attrval). op represents one amongst the 6 relation operators(EQ, LE, LT, GE, GT, NE corresponds to equal, less than equal, less than, greater than equal, greater than, not equal operators respectively). Attribute that is to be checked against the operater is denoted by attrval. Attribute cache provides the information on previous hit and it is modified if a new record hit is encountered. Record ID (block number, slot number) corresponding to the found record is returned. Search is continued until (-1, -1) is returned as the Record ID, indicating complete scan of all Leaf Blocks, thereby completing search.
                    <br>
                    A concise algorithmic procedure for search on a B+ Tree implemented in NITCbase is given below.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Consider a query to fetch the student records of all the students with RollNo >= 11<br> 
                    <br>Here, the search condition represented in the form (op, attrval) is <b>(GE, 85)</b>.<br>
                    At first we retrieve the value of Search Index field from the <a href="cache.html" target="_blank">Attribute Catalog Cache</a> and store it in the variable <b>searchIndex(block,index)</b>. Then, we reset the value of Search Index in the Attribute Catalog Cache to (-1, -1). This will be set to the correct index id if a record satisfying our condition i.e RollNo >= 11, is found in courseof the search.
                    Since, it is the first search the value retrieved and stored earlier in the searchIndex would be invalid.<br>
                    i.e searchIndex = (-1, -1)
                    <br> Traverse down the tree starting from the root, to find the first record in the leaf block that satisfies the search condition, i.e. attribute value of Roll No >= 11. First such record is that of student with RollNo 11. Since this is the first entry in the Leaf Block L5, Search Index in the Attribute Catalog Cache is set to this new index found, i.e (L5, 0). L5 is block number of the corresponding leaf index block and 0 is the offset of the index in that block. The The Record ID of this record that succeeded in satisfying the search condition, i.e <b>(Block# 8, Slot# 2)</b> is returned. <br><br>

                    Now, we proceed to the second iteration of Search. The searchIndex is updated with the new value retrieved from Search Index field of Attribute Catalog Cache. Search Index filed in the Attribute Catalog Cache is then reset to (-1, -1).
                    Since, there has been a previous hit, i.e. a previous record that satisfied the search condition, searchIndex would contain a valid Search index.<br>
                    i.e searchIndex = (L5, 0)<br>
                    <br>
                    Set the variable block = searchIndex.block and index = searchIndex + 1<br>
                    block = L5 and index = 0+1 = 1
                    We, linearly scan the leaf blocks from this point. As we begin, we get the next record that satisfies our search condition, the record with Rollno=12 wich lies at the offset 1 in the Leaf Index Block L5. Search Index in the Attribute Catalog Cache is set to this new index found, i.e (L5, 1) and the Record ID<b>(Block# 9, Slot# 3)</b> is returned. <br><br>

                    Now, we proceed to the third iteration of Search. The searchIndex is updated with the new value retrieved from Search Index field of Attribute Catalog Cache. Then, Search Index field of Attribute Catalog Cache is reset to (-1, -1). searchIndex would contain a valid Search index as there has been a previous hit.<br>
                    i.e searchIndex = (L5, 1)
                    <br>We set block = L5 and increment the index, i.e index = 1+1 = 2. <br>
                    From, the header of the Leaf Block L5, we observe that the number of entries is 2 which implies that the maximum value of offset possible is 1. So, update the block to its right block and set index = 0.<br>
                    Therefore, block = L6 and index = 0.
                    <br>As Leaf blocks are scanned linearly from this block, we immediately get the next hit at RollNo 13. Search Index field in the Attribute Catalog Cache is updated to this new index found (L6, 0). The Record ID of the corresponding record <b>(Block# 8, Slot# 3)</b> is returned.<br><br>

                    On proceeding with the next iteration of Search, searchIndex is updated with the Search Index field of Attribute Catalog Cache and then the Search Index field of Attribute Catalog Cache is reset to (-1, -1).
                    <br>
                    searchIndex = (L6, 0)
                    <br>
                    We set block = L6 and index = 0+1 = 1
                    On beginning linear scan from this point, we get a hit at RollNo 14. Search Index field in the Attribute Catalog Cache is updated to (L6, 1) and the corresponding Record ID <b>(Block# 10, Slot# 0)</b> is returned.<br><br>

                    We proceed onto the next iteration of search. searchIndex is updated with the Search Index field of Attribute Catalog Cache and Search Index field of Attribute Catalog Cache is reset to (-1, -1).
                    <br>
                    searchIndex = (L6, 0)
                    <br>
                    Set block = L6 and index = 1+1 = 2<br>
                    Header of the block L6 indicates that number of entries is 2 and so the maximum value of offset possible is 1.So, update the block to its right block and set index = 0. Since L6 is the last and rightmost Leaf Index Block in our linked list, RBlock of L6 is -1. <br>
                    block = -1 
                    <br>This implies that all the leaf blocks have been scanned, and search is completed. Return (-1, -1) as the Record ID to indicate this.
