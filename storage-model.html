                <h2>Disk Model</h2>
                <p> Nitcbase assumes that disk is a sequence of blocks and a block is a sequence of bytes. The disk consists of 8192 blocks and a block is of 2048 bytes. Hence there is a total of 16MB of storage. Disk blocks are indexed from 0 to 8191. </p>
                <p> Block# 0-3 are reserved for storing Block allocation map where as Block# 4, 5 are for storing first Block of <a class="link" href=#relcat>Relation Catalog</a> and <a class="link" href=#attrcat> Attribute Catalog</a> respectively. <b>Block allocation map</b> tells us whether a particular block is free or occupied and requires one byte per each block. Hence a total of 8192/2048=4 blocks are required for Block allocation map. The following figure summarizes the disk structure. </p>
                <center><img src="img/disk_model.png"></center>
                
                <p> Based on type of information stored in a block, a block can be of 2 types- 1. Record block, 2. Index block . </p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="record_blk" class="detail">
                <h2>Record block structure</h2>
                <p> Nitcbase is a collection of relations, and each relation is a collection of records.  The DBMS must store relations in the disk and the strategy is to store each relation in a set of blocks in the disk, organized as a linked list. Each block in such a linked list will be called a record block. The block will also contain some meta data like indices of the left and right blocks in the linked list. </p>
                <p> Records in a relation are composed of fields known as attributes each of which contains one item of information. Nitcbase fixes the size of attribute as 16 bytes.
                    But the records in a relation are of variable size, the size can vary from 16 bytes (record with single attribute) to the size that the record can fit in a block. </p>
                <p> A record block stores the actual data records. In addition to data records, each block also stores meta data in preamble/<b>header</b>. 
                The following figure shows the record block structure for a relation with K attributes. Since each attribute requires 16 bytes of storage space, to store record of this relation 16*K bytes must be allocated.</p>
                
                <center><img src="img/record_block.png"></center>
                
                <p> First four bytes(0-3) of header are used to identify the type of block(REC/IND) where REC represents a record block. Next four bytes(4-7) are used for storing parent block pointer which has no significance for a record block and can be set to -1. Byte# 8-11 and 12-15 are used for storing Left and right block numbers respectively. Next four bytes are used for storing number of records currently stored in the block. Byte#20-23 and 24-27 are used for storing #Attr (Number of attributes of the records of the relation that are stored in this block) and #Slots (Number of slots in this block) respectively. Bytes 24-31 are reserved for future use.</p>
                <p>  The record block is divided into <b>slots</b> of variable record size . Each slot stores a single record (and hence requires 16*K bytes for a relation with K attributes). Each block can have an arbitrary number of slots depending on the number of attributes in the relation. Number of slots (Maximum number of records, L) that fits in a block for any given relation can be calculated as:</p>
                
                <b><p> \[ 
                    32+L+L*(16*K) \leq 2048 \\
                    L*(16*K + 1 ) \leq 2016 \\
                    \#Slots = L = \left \lfloor \frac {2016} {((16 * \#Attributes(K)) + 1)} \right \rfloor 
                    \]</p></b>
                
                <!--center><img class="formula" src="img/num_slots_formula.png" width="50%"></center-->
                <p> The <b>slotmap</b>, which appears at the end of the header is used for indicating whether a slot is occupied or free. Size of the slotmap is equal to the number of slots, L, that fits in the block. If a slot is free, its corresponding entry in slotmap will be 0 else it will be 1. Slotmap starts from 32<sup>nd</sup>byte of the header followed by the slots which store actual records. Some amount of space may be left unused at the end whose size is less than the size of a record.</p>

                                    In Nitcbase, size of the record in any relation is bounded by the size of a block. Hence number of attributes is maximum when a record fits in a block. It is calculated as: <br>

                <h2>Internal Index Block Structure</h2>
                <p>Nitcbase uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+ tree</a> data structure for indexing records in a relation.  The DBMS may maintain zero or more <b>indices</b> per relation. There are two types of nodes for a B+ tree which are called <b>internal nodes</b> and <b>leaf nodes</b>. A disk block that stores an internal node of the B+ tree is called an Internal Index block. Each internal index block in Nitcbase stores a maximum of 100 attribute(key) values. Each of these values has an associated pair of <b>left and right child pointers</b>. Hence each internal index block is also required to store 101 child pointers (Only 101 Child pointers are required because the right child of one value is the same as the left child of the next value).</p>
                <center><img src="img/internal_index.png"></center>
                <p>An Internal index block is divided into two parts. First 32 bytes contain header followed by actual attribute(key) values and child pointers arranged alternatively as shown in the figure. The header meta data is similar to that of a record block. The first four bytes of the header stores the value INDINT. PBlock is the Block# of parent block in the corresponding B+ tree. LBlock and RBlock have no significance for this block. #Entries field stores the actual number of attribute values (of maximum 100) stored in the block. #Attrs and #Slots fields also have no significance for an internal index block. The remaining space in the header is left unused.</p>

            <div id="leafind_blk" class="detail">
                <h2>Leaf Index Block Structure</h2>
                <p>A leaf node in the B+ tree stores the actual indices for the records in a relation. A disk block that stores a leaf node of a B+ tree is called a <b>leaf index Block</b>. Each such block in Nitcbase stores a maximum of 63 indices. An index is a 3-tuple (attribute value, block number, slot number). The size of an index in nitcbase is 32 bytes.</p>
                <center><img src="img/leaf_node.png"></center>
                <p>Any Leaf Index Block is also divided into a header part of 32 bytes followed by a part containing actual indices. Header is similar to that of any other block. The first four bytes of the header stores the value INDLEAF. PBlock is the Block# of the parent block in the corresponding B+ tree. This entry must always contain block# of an Internal Index block. Since all leaf nodes are connected in a B+ tree, LBlock and RBlock point to left and right Leaf Index blocks respectively. #Entries stores the actual number of indices (of maximum 63) stored in the block. #Attrs and #Slots fields have no significance for a Leaf index block. The remaining space in the header is left unused.</p>

                <p> Nitcbase maintains two catalogs in the disk for storing the meta data information about relations, attributes, indexes etc. These catalogs are: </p>

Each entry in the Relation Catalog is of size 80 bytes and has the following attributes: Relation Name, #Attributes, #Records, First Block and #Slots per Block. In each entry, RelName(byte# 0-15) stores name of the relation, #Attributes(byte# 16-31) stores number of attributes of the relation, #Records(byte# 32-47) stores the number of records currently stored in the relation and First Block (byte# 48-63) stores the block number of the first record block of the relation. Since record blocks are arranged as linked list, First Block essentially stores head of the linked list, #Slots per block (byte# 64-79) stores the number of slots a record block of that relation has. This can be calculated from #Attributes</p>
