                            <p>Nitcbase assumes that the disk is a sequence of blocks, and a block is a sequence of bytes. The disk consists of 8192 blocks, and each block is of 2048 bytes, resulting in a total of 16MB of storage. Disk blocks are indexed from 0 to 8191.</p>
			    <p>Blocks 0-3 are reserved for storing Block Allocation Map, whereas Blocks 4 and 5 are reserved for storing the block of <a href=#relcat>Relation Catalog</a> and the first block of <a href=#attrcat>Attribute Catalog</a>, respectively. <b>Block Allocation Map</b> tells us whether a particular block is free or occupied. If occupied, it stores the type (<a href="constants.html" target="_blank">REC/IND_INTERNAL/IND_LEAF</a>) of the block. It requires one byte per each block. Hence a total of 8192/2048=4 blocks are required for Block Allocation Map. The following figure summarizes the disk structure. </p>

                             <p>Higher layers access the disk through the disk class. 
				The class contains a constructor, a destructor, a function to read from the disk, and a function to write to the disk. 
				Out of these functions, the readBlock and writeBlock are static. 
				C++ allows static functions to be accessed using the semantics classname::functionname() (instead of objectinstance->functionname() as in the case of methods that are not declared statically). 
				These are the only functions through which the disk can be accessed. These functions are supplied to you in the NITCbase package, and hence you do not need to implement them. 
				A single object of the class needs to be declared at the start of the session, whose sole purpose is to run the constructor and the destructor of the class.

                            <h2>Record block structure</h2>
                            <p> Nitcbase is a collection of relations, and each relation is a collection of records.  The DBMS must store relations in the disk and the strategy is to store each relation in a set of blocks in the disk, organized as a linked list. Each block in such a linked list will be called a record block. The block will also contain some metadata like indices of the left and right blocks in the linked list. </p>
                            <p> Records in a relation are composed of fields known as <b>attributes</b>, each of which contains one item of information. Nitcbase fixes the size of attribute as 16 bytes <span style="color: red">*</span>.
                                But the records in a relation are of variable size, the size can vary from 16 bytes (record with single attribute) to the size that the record can fit in a block. </p>
                            <p> A record block stores the actual data records. In addition to data records, each block also stores metadata in preamble/<b>header</b>. 
                            The following figure shows the record block structure for a relation with K attributes. Let L be the number of records stored in a block. (given K, L can be determined. This will be explained later.) Since each attribute requires 16 bytes of storage space, to store each record of this relation 16*K bytes must be allocated.</p>
                            <p><span style="color: red">*</span><b>Note:</b> In real-world database systems, the size of an attribute will vary depending on the type of the attribute.  For instance, an integer type attribute will require less storage space than a string type attribute.  In NITCbase, we fix the size of all attributes to the same value to simplify the implementation.  It is a conceptually straightforward (but cumbersome from the point of implementation) task to modify the DBMS to support variable-sized attributes. </p>
                            
                            <center><img class="img-fluid" src="img/record_block.png"></center>

                            <p> First four bytes(0-3) of header are used to identify the type of block(<a href="constants.html" target="_blank">REC/IND_INTERNAL/IND_LEAF</a>) where REC represents a record block. Next four bytes(4-7) are used for storing parent block pointer which has no significance for a record block and can be set to -1. Bytes 8-11 and 12-15 are used for storing Left and right block numbers respectively. Next four bytes are used for storing number of records currently stored in the block. Bytes 20-23 and 24-27 are used for storing #Attr (Number of attributes of the records of the relation that are stored in this block) and #Slots (Number of slots in this block) respectively. Bytes 28-31 are reserved for future use.</p>
                            <p>  Each record block is divided into <b>slots</b> of variable record size . Each slot stores a single record (and hence requires 16*K bytes for a relation with K attributes). Each block can have an arbitrary number of slots depending on the number of attributes in the relation. Number of slots (Maximum number of records, L) that fits in a block for any given relation can be calculated as:</p>

                            <b><p> \[ 
                                32+L+L*(16*K) \leq 2048 \\
                                L*(16*K + 1 ) \leq 2016 \\
                                \#Slots = L = \left \lfloor \frac {2016} {((16 * \#Attributes(K)) + 1)} \right \rfloor 
                                \]</p></b>

                            <!--center><img class="formula" src="img/num_slots_formula.png" width="50%"></center-->
                            <p> The <b>slotmap</b>, which appears at the end of the header is used for indicating whether a slot is occupied or free. Size of the slotmap is equal to the number of slots, L, that fits in the block. If a slot is free, its corresponding entry in slotmap will be 0 else it will be 1. Slotmap starts from 32<sup>nd</sup>byte of the header followed by the slots which store actual records. Some amount of space may be left unused at the end whose size is less than the size of a record.</p>
			    <p> The record block must be loaded from the disk to the main memory before its data can be accessed/modified.

The <a href="design/buffer.html#recbuff_class" target="_blank">RecBuffer class</a> is used to access a record block.

The DBMS may maintain zero or more <b>indices</b> per relation. There are two types of nodes for a B+ tree. These are called <b>internal nodes</b> and <b>leaf nodes</b>. A disk block that stores an internal node of the B+ tree is called an Internal Index block. Each internal index block in Nitcbase stores a maximum of 100 attribute(key) values. Each of these values has an associated pair of <b>left and right child pointers</b>. Hence each internal index block is also required to store 101 child pointers (Only 101 Child pointers are required because the right child of one value is the same as the left child of the next value).</p>

									<li>Relation Catalog</li>
									<li>Attribute Catalog</li>
								</ol>
								<p> In an RDBMS, a relation refers to a collection of records where each record is an n-tuple of attribute values. An attribute is a column or a field in a relation. A database is a collection of relations. </p>

								<h2>Relation Catalog</h2>
								<p> NITCbase has alloted a single block for the storage of Relation Catalog. Block 4 of the disk is used to store the Relation Catalog block. Relation Catalog is used for storing meta-information of the relations in a database. Each entry in the Relation Catalog has a size of 96 bytes and has the following six attributes: <i>RelationName, #Attributes, #Records, FirstBlock, LastBlock,</i> and <i>#SlotsPerBlock</i>. RelationName (bytes 0-15) stores the name of the relation, #Attributes(bytes 16-31) stores the number of attributes of that relation, and #Records(bytes 32-47) stores the number of records currently stored in that relation. The record blocks of a relation are arranged as a linked list. FirstBlock (bytes 48-63), which stores the block number of the first record block of the relation, essentially points to the head of the linked list. LastBlock (byte# 64-79), which stores the block number of the last record block of the relation, indicates the tail of the linked list. #SlotsPerBlock (bytes 80-95) stores the number of slots a record block of that relation has. (Note that #Slots can be calculated from #Attributes as described <a href="#record_blk">earlier</a>.)</p>

								<h2>Attribute Catalog</h2>
								<p> Attribute Catalog stores meta-information regarding all the attributes of each relation. NITCbase allows Attribute Catalog to be stored over multiple blocks arranged as a linked list. The LBlock and RBlock fields in the header are used to traverse the linked list. Each entry of the Attribute Catalog has the following six attributes: <i>RelationName, AttributeName, AttributeType, PrimaryFlag, RootBlock,</i> and <i>Offset</i>. RelationName is the name of the relation corresponding to the attribute, AttributeName is the name of the attribute and AttributeType is the data type of the attribute. Only three data types are permitted by Nitcbase- integer, floating-point numbers, and strings (of maximum size 16). The PrimaryFlag is presently unused<span style="color: red">*</span>. Nitcbase employes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+ tree</a> for indexing. RootBlock stores the root block number of the B+ tree if there is an index created on the attribute; and contains -1 otherwise. Offset is an integer that specifies the relative offset of the attribute in the record (0 for the first attribute, 1 for the second attribute, etc).</p>
								<p><span style="color: red">*</span> At present, Nitcbase does not support the notion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key" target="_blank">primary key</a>. The flag is kept in the slot for future support of primary keys.  </p>

										<li>Attribute Catalog is internally implemented as a relation. Hence, it's block structure is identical to that of any record block with six attributes.</li>
