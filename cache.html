                <p>The job of this module is to cache the catalogs information of 'opened' relations in memory and store any other memory meta data, thereby providing immediate access to this information whenever required by any other layer. Since catalog information is frequently required by any query processing modules, this layer of caching reduces the number of disk access made for those catalogs. Also this provides clean interface to these catalogs and hence hiding how the catalogs are stored and maintained internally. the following diagram summarizes the design of this module with public interfaces provided.</p>

                <h2> Relation Cache</h2>
                <p>Relation catalog stores metadata coresponding to all relations in the system. In addition to storing this information in the disk, a set of relation catalog entries of open relations are cached in the main memory for easy access to this information and to achieve a good performance. This is called Relation Cache. A maximum of MAXOPEN = 12 relations are cached at the same time. Relation Cache contains all the fields from relation catalog and type of each entry is defined as 'struct RelCatEntry' as shown below:</p>
                <div class="code">
    typedef struct RelCatEntry {
        char rel_name[ATTR_SIZE];
        int num_attr;
        int num_rec;
        int first_blk;          //Head of linked list of blocks
        int num_slots_blk;      //Number of slots in a block
    } RelCatEntry ;</div>
                In addition to these fields, few more information is stored in <a href="#openreltable">open relation table</a>.

                <h2> Attribute Cache</h2> 
                <p>Attribute catalog, analogous to relation catalog stores meta information for every attribute in every relation of the system. In addition to storing this catalog in disk, attribute catalog information for a set of open relations is also cached in the main memory for easy access and also for performance reasons. This is called Attribute Cache. Attribute cache will be stored for every open relation (every relation whose relation catalog entry cached also has its attribute catalog entries cached). Hence we can cache attribute catalog information for atmost MAXOPEN=12 relations.Each Attribute Cache entry contains all the fields from attribute catalog and some extra fields as explained below. Type of memory cached attribute catalog entry is defined as 'AttrCatEntry' and that of Attribute Cache entry is defined as 'AttributeCache'. Since a relation can have an arbitrary number of attributes (though it is bounded in Nitcbase), Attribute cache is stored in memory as a linked list of Attribute Cache entries.</p>
                <div class="code">
    typedef struct AttrCatEntry {
        char rel_name[ATTR_SIZE];
        char attr_name[ATTR_SIZE];
        int attr_type;
        bool primary_flag;
        int root_block;
        int offset;
    } AttrCatEntry ;

    typedef struct AttributeCache {
        AttrCatEntry attrcat_entry;
        bool dirty;
        recId rec_id;
        SearchIndexId sid;          /*IMPORTANT: used for storing state information of any search.
                                                which will be used for getting next hit. */
        struct AttributeCache *next;
    } AttributeCache;
                </div>
                <p>As already stated, Attribute cache also stores some inmemory information which will not be committed back to disk. They are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>dirty: Indicates whether the attribute catalog entry is modified</li>
                    <li>rec_id: Stores the record id (block#, slot#) of the attribute catalog entry in the disk. This is useful to commit the catalog entry to disk when it is modified.</li>
                    <li>sid: This is used to store state of any search operation. It essentially stores information regardng last/previous hit. Search interfaces uses this information to know where previous search call returned and to quickly search for the next hit.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div id="openreltable" class="detail">
                <h2>Open Relation Table</h2>
                <p>Cache layer stores the catalog cache in a tablular structure called Open Relation Table. An open relation table consists of a total of MAXOPEN=12 rows. Each row corresponds to an open relation. The index to the open relation table is considered as the relation identifier (relId). Any layer that wishes to access the meta information of a open relation need to access it using its relId. Each row in the Open Relation Table has the following fields:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>relcat_entry: cached relation catalog entry of the relation</li>
                    <li>free: Indicates whether the row is free or occupied.</li>
                    <li>dirty: Indicates whether relation catalog entry is modified.</li>
                    <li>rec_id: Stores the record id (block#, slot#) of the relation catalog entry in the disk. This is useful to commit the catalog entry to disk when it is modified.</li>
                    <li>attr_list: Head of the linked list storing attribute catalog cache whose length is equal to number of attributes in the relation.</li>
                </ol>
                <center><img src="img/openreltable.png" style="width: 80%"></center>
                <p>The above figure shows the structure of Open relation table. Both the catalogs are stored as relations internally and have entries corresponding to themselves. Name of relation catalog is "relcat" and that of attribute catalog is "attrcat". These catalogs will always be open with predefined relation ids as 0 and 1 respectively. In other words, first row of the open relation table corresponds to Relation Catalog and second row corresponds to Attribute Catalog.</p>
                <p>Open Relation Table is a static class (<b>Note:</b> In C++ static classes can be implemented by declaring each field and member function as static explicitly) which means there exists only a single static object of the class at any point of time. The actual table(data) is private to the class and access to the information is provided through public methods which define interface to the cache layer. Since all interfaces are static, they can be called on the class name instead of calling on an object (object is allocated statically). Class structure showing public interfaces can be found in the following code:</p>

                </div>
                <p>The interfaces given by cache layer to other layers are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
