                            <p> The job of this module is to cache the catalog information of 'opened' relations in memory. Some meta data related to open relations is also managed by the cache layer. thereby providing immediate access to this information whenever required by any other layer. Since catalog information is frequently required by any query processing module, this layer of caching reduces the number of disk accesses for those catalogs. The cache layer provides a clean interface to for catalog access, hiding from the higher layers how the catalogs are stored and maintained internally. The following diagram summarizes the design of this module with public interfaces provided. </p>

                        <p>Relation catalog stores metadata coresponding to all relations in the system. In addition to storing this information in the disk, a set of relation catalog entries of open relations are cached in the main memory for easy access to this information and to achieve a good performance. This is called Relation Cache. A maximum of MAXOPEN = 12 relations are cached at the same time. Relation Cache contains all entries of the correspondig relation catalog entry.  Each cache entry is stored as a 'RelCatEntry' structure as shown below:</p>
                		<div class="code"><pre><code>typedef struct RelCatEntry {
    char rel_name[ATTR_SIZE];
    int num_attr;
    int num_rec;
    int first_blk;          //Head of linked list of blocks
    int num_slots_blk;      //Number of slots in a block
} RelCatEntry ;</code></pre></div>
                		<p>In addition to the cached copy of relation catalog entry, Nitcbase maintains some meta-data for each open relation in an <a href="#openrel_table">open relation table</a>. Relation cache entry for an open relation is part of open relation table entry for the relation.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h2>Attribute Cache</h2>
                            <p>The Attribute catalog, analogous to the relation catalog stores meta information for every attribute in every relation of the system. In addition to storing this catalog in the disk, the attribute catalog information for a set of open relations is also cached in the main memory for performance reasons and  easy access. The attribute catalog cache for opened relations is called the Attribute Cache. An Attribute cache entry will be created for every open relation. (Each relation whose relation catalog entry is cached in the relation cache will also have its attribute catalog entries cached in the attribute cache.) Hence the attribute catalog information for atmost MAXOPEN=12 relations are cached. Each Attribute Cache entry contains all the fields from attribute catalog and some extra fields for storing meta-data as explained below. Type of memory cached attribute catalog entry is defined as 'AttrCatEntry' and that of Attribute Cache entry is defined as 'AttributeCache'. Since a relation can have a variable number of attributes (though the maximum number of attributes for a relation is bounded in Nitcbase by 125 - why?), Attribute cache is stored in memory as a linked list of Attribute Cache entries.</p>

                    			<li><i>prev_recid</i>: This is used to store state of any search operation. It essentially stores information regardng last/previous hit. Search interfaces uses this information to know where previous search call returned and to quickly search for the next hit.</li>

                        	<h2>Open Relation Table</h2>
                        	<p>Cache layer stores the catalog cache in a tablular structure called Open Relation Table. Open relation table consists of a total of MAXOPEN=12 entries. Each entry corresponds to an open relation. The index to the entry in open relation table is considered as the relation identifier (relId). Any layer that wishes to access the meta information of an open relation need to access it using its relId. Each row in the Open Relation Table has the following fields:</p>
                        	<ol>
                        		<li>relcat_entry: cached relation catalog entry of the relation</li>

                    			<li>dirty: Indicates whether relation catalog entry is modified.</li>
                    			<li>rec_id: Stores the record id (block#, slot#) of the relation catalog entry in the disk. This is useful to commit the catalog entry to disk when it is modified.</li>
                    			<li>attr_list: Head of the linked list storing attribute catalog cache whose length is equal to number of attributes in the relation.</li>
                			</ol>

                        	<p>The above figure shows the structure of Open relation table.</p>
                			<p>Relation catalog and the attribute catalog are the only two "default" relations in Nitcbase.  (The catalogs which store meta-information about other relations are themselves treated as relations by Nitcbase).  Hence both the relation catalog and the attribute catalog contain entries corresponding to themselves.  The relation catalog entry for the relation catalog has Relname set to the default name "relcat".   The relation catalog entry for the attribute catalog has Relname set to the default name "attrcat".  The attribute catalog will contain default entries corresponding each attribute of the relation catalog and each attribute of the attribute catalog.  The relation catalog and the attribute catalog are always open, with predefined relation ids as 0 and 1 respectively. Consequently, the first and the second entries of the open relation table corresponds to the Relation Catalog and the Attribute Catalog respectively.</p>
                			<p>Open Relation Table is a static class (<b>Note:</b> In C++ static classes can be implemented by declaring each field and member function as static explicitly). <b>This means that there exists only a single static object of the class at any point of time</b>. The actual table(data) is private to the class and access to the information is provided through public methods which define interface to the cache layer. Since all interfaces are static, they can be called on the class name instead of calling on an an instance (as the object is allocated statically).</p>
