                <h2>Disks Model</h2>
                <p>Nitcbase assumes that disk is a sequence of blocks and a block is a sequence of bytes. The disk consists of 8192 blocks and a block is of 2048 bytes. Hence there is a total of 16MB of storage. Disk blocks are indexed from 0 to 8191. </p>
                <p> Block# 0-3 are reserved for storing Block allocation map where as Block# 4 is for storing Database Catalog. Block allocation map tells us whether a particular block is free or occupied and requires one byte per each block. Hence a total of 8192/2048=4 blocks are required for Block allocation map. The following figure summarizes the disk structure. </p>
                <center><img src="img/disk_model1.png"></center>
                
                <p> Based on type of information stored in a block, a block can be of 5 types- 1. Record block, 2. Index block, 3.Database Catalog block, 4.Relation Catalog block, 5.Attribute catalog block.</p>

                <h2>Record block structure</h2>
                <p> A database in Nitcbase is a collection of relations, and each relation is a collection of records.  The DBMS must store relations in the disk and the strategy is to store each relation in a set of blocks in the disk, organized as a linked list. Each block in such a linked list will be called a record block and is designed to store a fixed number of records.  The block will also contains some meta data like indices of the left and right blocks in the linked list.  Nitcbase fixes the size of a record as 256 bytes. </p>
                <p>A record block stores the actual data records. The record block is divided into slots of size 256 Bytes each. Each slot stores a single record. Each block can have a maximum of 7 slots/records. In addition to data records, each block also stores meta data in preamble/header which occupies the first 256 Bytes of the record block.</p>
                <center><img src="img/record_block1.png"></center>
                <p>First four bytes(0-3) of header are used to identify the type of block(REC/IND/DBCAT/RELCAT/ATTRCAT) where REC represents a record block. Next four bytes(4-7) are used for storing parent block pointer which has no significance for a record block and can be set to -1. Byte# 8-11 and 12-15 are used for storing Left and right block numbers respectively. Next four bytes are used for storing number of records currently stored in the block whose value can range from 0 to 7. Bytes 20-31 are reserved for future use.</p>
                <p> Slotmap is used for knowing whether a slot is occupied or free. It is of 7 bytes, one for each slot. If a slot is free, its corresponding entry in slotmap will be 0 else it will be 1. Slotmap occupies 32-38 bytes of the header. Note that the number of non-zero entries in the slotmap must match with the value in the #Entries field.  
                Rest of the bytes in the header i.e., 39-255 are unallocated.</p>
                <p>A Record can have a maximum of 16 attributes and an attribute can have a maximum of 16 Bytes. Each attribute is alloted a fixed size of 16 bytes and hence each record is alloted a fixed size of 256 bytes in disk.</p>

            <div id="index_blk" class="detail">
                <h2>Index block structure</h2>
                <p>Nitcbase uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-Tree</a> data structure for indexing records in a relation.  The DBMS maintains at least one index per relation (and possibly more on requirement).  Corresponding to each index of a relation, the DBMS mantains a B-Tree to store the indices.  Each node of a B-Tree is stored into a block in the disk.  A disk block that stores a node of a B-Tree is called an index block.   Each index block in Nitcbase is designed to store a maximum of 55 indices.  An index is a 3-tuple (attribute value, block number, slot number).  Each index in a B-Tree node also has an associated pair of left and right child block pointers.  Hence, in addition to the indices, each index block is required to store a total of 56 child pointers. (Only 56 Child pointers are required because the right child of one index is the same as the left child of the next index).</p>
                <center><img src="img/index_block.png"></center>
                <p>An index block is divided into three parts.  The first 32 bytes contain a header, the next 1760 bytes store the indices, the following 224 bytes store the child pointers and the last 32 bytes are unused.  The header contains meta data similar to that of a record block. The first four bytes of the header stores the value IND.  PBlock is the Block# of parent block in the B-Tree. LBlock and RBlock have no significance for an index block. #Entries field stores the actual number of indices stored in the block. The remaining space in the header are left unused.</p>
                
                <p>Each entry in the index block is a 3-tuple (attribute value, block number, slot number) corresponding to the particular record. Block# and slot# occupy 4 bytes each and any attribute occupies 16 bytes.  Thus each index requires 24 bytes.  Eight bytes of unused space is maintained for future use.  Thus a total of 32 bytes are allocated for a single index entry.  Since an index block can store upto 55 indices, the total space required for storing indices is 55*32=1760.  Each child pointer requires 4 bytes of storage and  the total space for storing 56 child pointers works out to 56*4 = 224.  The remaining space in the block (32 bytes) is left unused.</p>
                <!--p> Note:  An index block has enough space to actually store 38 indices, but the number was limited to 37 because B-Tree algorithms are easier to implement when the maximum number of indices in a node is odd. </p-->

                <p>A relational database has a number of catalogs for storing the meta data information about databases, relations, attributes, indexes etc. Nitcbase uses three types of catalogs for storing the meta data.  </p>

                <h2>Database Catalog</h2>
                <p>Nitcbase stores database catalog in Block# 4 of the disk. Every database has an entry corresponding to itself in database cataog. Since there are 62 entries in the Database Catalog block, a maximum of 62 databases are permitted in total. Each entry in the database catalog is of size 32 bytes. Database catalog has three attributes- DBName, RelCat_Index and #Relations. In each entry of the database catalog, DBName(0-15 bytes) stores the name of the database, RelCatBlk(16-19 bytes) stores the  Block# of relation catalog for the database, #Relations(20-23 bytes) specify the current number of relations present in the database and the next 8 bytes(24-31) are unused. In addition to Database Catalog information, this block also stores meta data in a preamble/header.  The header occupies the first 96 Bytes of the Database Catalog block. The structure of the database catelog can be inferred from the figure. </p>
                
                <p>The first four bytes of the header stores the value DBCAT which indicates that the block is currently storing the Database Catalog. PBlock, LBlock and RBlock have no significance for the Database Catalog block. #Entries field stores the actual number of Database Catalog entries stored in the block (and represents number of databases currently present in the system). The next 8 bytes(byte# 24-31) are reserved for future use, Slotmap occupies the next 62 bytes(byte# 32-93)(can be seen in figure), where each byte corresponds to one entry in the database catalog. The remaining 2 bytes of header(byte#- 94-95) are left unused.

                <h2>Relation Catalog</h2>
                <p>Correspoding to each database in Nitcbase (that is, each entry in the database catalog), a Relation Catalog entry that stores the meta information regarding relations in the database needs to be maintained. Hence, each database has a relation catalog. Each entry in a Relation Catalog is of size 64 bytes and has the following attributes: RelName, #Attributes, AttrCat_Index, #Records and RecBlk_Index. In each entry, RelName(byte# 0-15) stores name of the relation, #Attributes(byte# 16-19) stores number of attributes of the relation, AttrCatBlk(byte# 20-23) stores the block number of Attribute Catalog of the relation, #Records(byte# 24-27) stores the number of records currently stored in the relation and FirstBlk (byte# 24-27) stores the block number of the first record block of the relation. Since record blocks are arranged as a linked list, FirstBlkInd essentially stores head of the linked list.  The next 32 bytes of each entry(byte# 32-63) are kept free. Nitcbase allocates one block for each relation catalog.  Since a maximum of 31 entries can be stored in a block, a database in Nitcbase can have a maximum of 31 relations.</p>
                
                <p>Relation Catalog block also stores the meta data about the block in a preamble/header that is stored in the first 64 Bytes of the Relation Catalog block.  The structure of the Relation Catalog can be inferred from the figure. </p>
                
                <p>The first four bytes of the header stores the value RELCAT which indicates that the block is currently storing a Relation Catalog. PBlock, LBlock and RBlock have no significance for a Relation Catalog block. #Entries field(byte# 16-19) stores the actual number of Relation Catalog entries stored in the block. Byte# 20-31 are kept reserved for future use. Slotmap occupies next 31 bytes(byte# 32-62), where each byte corresponds to one entry in the Relation catalog. The remaining 1 byte of header(byte#- 63) is left unused.

                <h2>Attribute Catalog</h2>
                <p>Corresponding to each relation in each database in Nitcbase, an attribute catalog is maintained. (Thus, corresponding to each Database in the Database Catalog, there is a Relation Catalog; and corresponding to each relation in every Relation Catalog, there is an Attibute Catalog.) Each Attribute Catalog stores the meta information regarding every attribute of the corresponoding relation.  Each entry in the Attribute Catalog of a relation has the following fields: AttrName, AttrType, RootBlk and Primary Flag.  Attrname is the name of the attribute and Attrtype is the data type of the attribute.  Nitcbase permits three data types for attributes. They are integer, float and string (of maximum 16 characters). Nitcbase uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-Tree</a> data structure for indexing. The RootBlk field of an Attribute Catalog entry stores the root block number of the corresponding indexing B-Tree whenever an index has been created on the attribute.  (The value is set to -1 otherwise.)  Since Nitcbase permits a maximum of 16 attributes for a relation, each Attribute Catalog  contains 16 entries. (If a relation has fewer than 16 attributes, some of the attribute catalog entries of the relation will be unsused.  The values of all the fields of unused attribute catalog entries are set to -1.) The structure of an Attribute Catalog
                can be inferred from the figure. </p>
                <p>A disk block can store upto three attibute catalogs.  As in other block types, Attribute Catalog also stores the meta data about the block in a preamble/header which occupies the first 96 Bytes of the Attribute Catalog block.  </p>
                
                <p>The first four bytes of the header stores the value ATTRCAT which indicates that the block is currently storing an Attribute Catalog. PBlock, LBlock and RBlock have no significance for an Attribute Catalog block. #Entries field (byte# 16-19) stores the actual number of Attribute Catalog entries stored in the block. Byte# 20-31 are kept reserved for future use.  Slotmap occupies the next 48 bytes(byte# 32-79), with each byte corresponding to an entry in the Attributes catalog. The remaining  16 bytes of the header(byte#- 80-95) are left unused.
