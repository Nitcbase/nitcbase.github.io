                <p>A relational database has a number of catalogs for storing the meta data information about databases, relations, attributes, indexes etc. In addition to storing these catalogs in disk, a DBMS also caches some of them in memory for quick access. Such cache is called Catalog cache. Nitcbase uses three types of catalogs for storing the meta data. In Nitcbase these catalogs themselves are implemented as relations internally. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Database Catalog</li>
                    <li>Relation Catalog</li>
                    <li>Attribute Catalog</li>
                </ol> 
                <p>In an RDBMS, a relation refers to collection of records where each record is an n-tuple of attribute values. An attribute is a column or field in a relation. A database is a collection of relations.</p>

                <h2>Database Catalog</h2>
                <p>Nitcbase stores database catalog in Block# 4 of the disk. Every database has an entry corresponding to itself in database cataog. Since there are only 7 slots in a block, a maimum of 7 databases are permitted in total. Database catalog has three attributes- DBName, RelCat_Index and #Relations, where DBName stores the name of the database, RelCat_Index stores first Block# of relation catalog for the database and #Realtions specify the current number of relations present in the database. The structure of each slot canbe inferred from the figure. </p>

                <p>NOTE: Though database catalog is also implemented as relation internally, there will not be entry corresponding to it in any of the relation/Attribute catalogs.</p>

            <div class="detail" id="relcat">
                <h2>Relation Catalog</h2>
                <p>Relation Catalog stores mata information regarding relations in a database. Each database has a relation catalog. Attributes of a relation catalog are RelName, #Attributes, AttrCat_Index, #Records and RecBlk_Index where RelName is name of the relation, #Attributes is number of attributes of the relation, AttrCat_Index is the first block number of Attribute Catalog of the relation, #Records is the number of records currently stored in the relation and RecBlk_Index is the first block number of the record blocks of the relation. Since record blocks are arranged as linked list, RecBlk_Index essentially stores head of the linked list. Nitcbase allocates two blocks for a relation catalog (arranged as a doubly linked list). Hence a database can have a maximum of 14 relations (including relation catalog).</p>

                <p>Since relation catalog is also implemented as a relation internally, It has entry corresponding to itself, usually the first entry.</p>

                <h2>Attribute Catalog</h2>
                <p>Attribute Catalog stores meta information regarding every attribute of a relation. There is an attribute catalog corresponding to every relation. Attributes of attribute catalog are AttrName, AttrType and RootBlk_Index where Attrname is name of the attribute and Attrtype is data type of the attribute. Nitcbase permits three data types for attributes. They are integer, floating point numbers and strings(of maximum size 16). Nitcbase uses B-Tree for indexing. RootBlk_Index stores the root block number of the B-Tree if there is an index created on the attribute else it contains -1. Since Nitcbase permits a maximum of 16 attributes per relation and each block has 7 slots, attribute catalog can occupy a maximum of 3 blocks.</p>
